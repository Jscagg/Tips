    <h1> Hello and welcome!</h1>    
        <p> You're probably wondering who I am, and what this is. Let me explain. I'm a thirty year old who's worked mostly manual labor jobs and is looking for a career change. I'm following along with T.O.P (The Odin Project) in order to teach myself coding. Web Dev specifically, to get my foot in the door in this field. There's something that I've noticed while I've been browsing around reddit: No one tells of their failures and trials.
        </p>

        <p> Understandably no one wants to be looked at as a failure, or admit that they *have* failed. But all that does, is create an unrealistic vision for the rest of us. We hear stories here from people who self taught for a few months or a year, or went to boot camp and immediate got a job in this field right after. Or how the self teachers, with a good portfolio got a job within a year. Those stories may be true, I'm not doubting anyone. For those who lived that, that's awesome! Good for them that it all worked out! But for every one story of ' I got a job after six months', there's a hundred others of 'I've been trying for three years'.
        </p>
        
        <p> So my goal with this, is to document my journey. I'll list down things I've learned, stuff I've discovered on my own, tips, tricks, and whatever else comes to mind. I'll also tell everyone how I've failed. Whether its eventually bombed interviews, how I didn't get jobs, or how I failed at projects I tried to make. As embarrassing as it may be, I'll tell everyone how I spent six hours trying to get one line of code to work, only to realize that it was failing because I forgot a closing /. As I learn and grow, so too will this journal, or blog, or whatever you want to call it. As I learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JS, this page will become more functional, organized, and pleasing to the eye. It'll get buttons and tabs, and errors that I spend hours trying to fix. And I will tell you all about it, so that anyone else starting, or going through this journey, know's that they're not the only one struggling and having issues. We've all failed at some point, and I'm going to show you all of mine.</p>

        <p>Its Monday, July 25th, at 9:20 PM EST and I'm sitting in a basement. (Don't ask.) And this is the beginning of many trials and errors. By this time next year, I'm hoping that I know enough to start applying to Jr Web Dev jobs. That's my goal as stated on...Well, on your screen!
