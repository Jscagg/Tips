    <h1>Just HTML things</h1>
    <p>What is HTML exactly? Simply put HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. Its the most basic building block of the web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.</p>
    <un>
        
        <li> Make unordered lists such as this one using the "un" command with opening and closing arrows and a closing /. </li>
        <li>Also found out that bringing the <.p> element down a line from the paragraph that's being written makes the words wrap around the screen, instead of continuing on endlessly in a side scroller. Pro tip: take the period out of that paragraph element otherwise it won't work as an opener! </li>
    </un>
    <ol>
        
        <li> Making an ordered list such as this is the same syntax for the Unordered Lists just with "ol" instead of "un". And to make the individual items, you use the <.li> elements just like you would for an unordered list. </li>
            <li> Found out that <strong> Strong</strong> is the html for bold.</li>
            <li> And that <em> em is the one for italics! </em></li>
            <li> There are 6 different sizes of Headers. The "Hello and welcome" is the biggest one! The other header on this page is size 3. The largest one is h1, and the smallest is h6. </li>
    </ol>
    <un>
    <li><a href="./index.html">Back to main</a></li>
    <li><a href="hyper.html">Back to top</a></li>
    </un>
