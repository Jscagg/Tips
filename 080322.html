    <h1>Working with CSS.</h1>
    <p>Started on CSS today. It was....a lot. The first page on CSS goes into a lot of detail. There's a bunch to break down and go over, and honestly its overwhelming. I got to the end of the page, realized that I didn't really retain any of what I read or really even understand it for that matter. It might sound dumb, but I started to question whether or not I should even be doing this. It was one of those "I'm not cut out for this, I'm to stupid to understand it" moments.Yes, even after just one small set back at the very start of my journey, I questioned this decision. Like I'm sure a lot of us have.</p>

    <p>I knew that once I started on the practice stuff, it would click more. I've always been a hands on learner. One of the reasons I understood the linux stuff and the HTML breakdown was because I was able to follow along with it as I was learning. I wasn't given a page full of stuff to read and then sent off. Everything was broken down into 'This does Y. Open your terminal/VScode and replicate it to see what happens.'. The first CSS page didn't have that. It was a big page with breakdowns of all kinds of things I didn't understand, and I was left feeling very lost and confused.</p>

    <p>So I finished it up, and followed along with the practice exercises. I'll be honest, I kept going back and checking the TOP page on how to do things. My laptop can split screen, one program taking up half of one side of the screen, and another program taking up the other. I had VScode open on one half, and Chrome open on the other with the TOP page for CSS so I could look at and replicate their code because gods know I didn't remember any of it even though I just read it.</p>

    <p>Line by line I went, working out the first practice project. Little dumb things for most people I'm sure, like changing text size, background color, text color, and placement. But the more I did it and played with things, the more I understood how stuff worked...Maybe I should rephrase that. I might not *understand* exactly how it works yet, but I know how to make things look different. I don't understand ID's, classes and selectors yet, but I can play with the header on this page. I can change the paragraph text size and color if I want to without having to look up the syntax for the code. </p>

    <p>Moral of the story: Be scared, doubt yourself, wonder if you're on the right path, then push through and do it anyway. That first CSS page is scary, for sure. But if you know, like me, that you'll start to understand it more once you start to implement it, then keep going and learn through doing. Learning knew things is supposed to make you feel like a big dummy at some point, and that's totally fine and normal!</p>

    <p>Here's something not many people tell you: Its ok to be discouraged. Its ok to want to give up, and to feel like you can't do something. That's all totally fine and normal. What's not ok is actually giving up.So feel like you're not good enough to do it, let yourself experience that emotion for a while, then make yourself do it anyway. And yes, I'm writing this out as much for myself, as a reminder to keep pushing instead of quitting, just as much as I'm writing it for anyone that may read it.</p>
