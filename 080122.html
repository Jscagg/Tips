    <p>Last thursday I completed the recipe book project. It wasn't as hard as I was worried it would be. I learned a lot doing it, and it in the lessons before hand. Like how to link to html files in other directories, how to show pictures on the webpage, and how to resize those images. Learning how to resize them was something I had to do outside of TOP. At that point in the curriculum TOP hadn't been over how to resize images.</p>
    <p>I've seen plenty of posts from people mentioning how planning out what you're going to code, is just as important as knowing how to code it. Tonight I'm finding that to be very true. I haven't done any studying tonight. I planned on spending the night working on the journal. Making new links and pages, adding some pictures and gifs, and just in general reorganizing it and making it look better.</p>
    <p>In order to do that though, I had to sit down and plan everything out. I had thought (wrongly) that I could just sit here and make things as I thought of them. And while I can to an extent, I'm finding myself getting a bit overwhelmed. Not in a 'I don't know how to do this' aspect, but more of a 'where do I start?' aspect. Every time I think of something to do, I also realize that I need to do two or three other things, before I can do that initial thing I thought of. So I think for tonight, I'm just going to plan out what I want to do, make a sort of 'to do' list, and then tomorrow night I can go down the list and check things off as I go. Make a plan, and set it into motion!</p>
